# AGENTS.md — maintainer notes for true-up

Audience: **dev agents** maintaining/extending true-up. Users read [`README.md`](./README.md);
agents running true-up in their own repo read [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

## What this is

A deterministic Git/jj-native dependency-graph engine for "truing up" a repo. Extracted from an
internal corpus where it was proven; this repo is the standalone, repo-agnostic tool.

## Layout

```
bin/true-up        thin CLI entry → lib/engine.mjs
lib/engine.mjs     the engine: build / --check[ --committed] / --impact / --policy / --externalities / --verify-scope / run / export / init / capabilities / --version / --help (every read-side cmd takes --json)
lib/symbols.mjs    Tier 2 (OPTIONAL): tree-sitter symbol extraction. Static-imported but loads
                   web-tree-sitter LAZILY (only when .true-up.json sets "symbols") — the zero-dep core never touches it
tests/engine.sh    fixture-based regression harness (synthesizes a target repo, runs the real CLI)
docs/CONFIG.md     the .true-up.json schema + the marker/anchor conventions
examples/          an example .true-up.json
meta/build-contract.mjs  generates meta/contract.json from `true-up capabilities`; --check gates engine→contract drift
meta/contract.json the command + agent-guidance STEWARD (generated, committed) — true-up trues itself against it
workflows/         external-agent maintenance/audit workflow templates; shipped in npm because SKILL.md links them
package.json       npm allowlist + optional tree-sitter peer/dev deps (EXACT-pinned, Tier 2 only); posttest = self-gate
.true-up.json      true-up's own config — it trues up ITSELF, MARKER-FREE (steward + sidecar seed; see "Self-dogfood")
```

## CLI surface + exit contract (the gates exit nonzero)

The CLI is a set of gates, so exit codes are load-bearing — wire them straight into pre-commit/CI.
Verify against `lib/engine.mjs` before changing any of this.

- `true-up status [--since <ref>]` — **read-only ORIENTATION mega-command** (Axiom 10): one call returns workspace identity (`workspace.root`, target source `cwd`/`$TRUE_UP_REPO`/`--repo`, Git linked-worktree metadata, jj mode, mismatch warnings), built/stale, graph stats, what's stale since `<ref>` (mechanical + advisory worklist), policy/leak status, and copy-paste `nextCommands[]`. Exits 0 as a probe (not a gate — `gate` is the authoritative CI exit), exits 2 only for usage errors such as a bad `--since` ref/revset, and writes nothing. The canonical first command an agent reaches for; `triage`/`doctor`/`overview`/`update`/`docs` etc. redirect here or to the right verb via an intent/synonym map (not just lexical did-you-mean). Multi-agent/multi-worktree agents must inspect `.workspace` before acting on `nextCommands`.
- `true-up graph [--json]` — **read-only graph inspection**: prints the actual nodes, audiences/zones, edges, propagation, and generator `via` fields. This is the command for "show me the graph" / "look at the data"; writes nothing.
- `true-up build` — explicit verb for the bare build below (discoverable alias).
- `true-up` (no args) — (re)build + write the graph JSON to `out` (default `.true-up/depgraph.json`). Exit 1 on an unresolved anchor (fail-loud); otherwise exit 0. Prints a NOTICE when no facts/edges are declared (the drift layer is INERT).
- `true-up --check` — working-tree freshness: exit 1 if the ON-DISK graph differs from a fresh rebuild.
- `true-up --check --committed` — the real drift gate: exit 1 if the VCS-stored graph blob differs from a fresh rebuild. Git prefers the staged blob for pre-commit, else `HEAD:` for CI; jj-only reads `@`. A missing/untracked graph fails (false assurance is worse than none).
- `true-up --impact <path|path#fact>… [--since <ref>] [--proof]` — who is made stale; exit 0. It must list every dependent artifact; do not collapse generated outputs just because they share one generator `via`. With `--since`, the default view is "remaining stale"; `--proof` adds an audit map from changed facts/sources to dependents and marks whether dependents changed in the same range. A bad Git ref / jj revset exits 2 (not a silent "0 dependents"); no graph on disk exits 2.
- `true-up --policy [--report]` — zone/visibility lint. **EXIT 1 on violations**; `--report` forces exit 0 (report-only).
- `true-up --externalities [--report]` — machine-local-path leak scan. **EXIT 1 on leaks**; `--report` forces exit 0.
- `true-up --verify-scope [--since <ref>]` — anti-code-golf gate: exit 1 (naming the file) if a changed file is not explained by the graph (the changed source, its regenerated/advisory dependents, or the cache). Vacuous (exit 0, stderr NOTE) on a no-edge repo. Bad ref exits 2.
- `true-up run [--since <ref>] [--strict]` — deterministic truing-up loop; exit 1 if not GREEN (regen failed / policy violations / depgraph stale), exit 2 under `--strict` when GREEN but advisory prose review is still pending. Verify reads the `--policy` child's EXIT CODE, not its stdout.
- `true-up gate [--committed]` — one CI stage: spawns `--check` (+`--committed`) · `--policy` · `--externalities` as children and exits **1 if ANY fails**, 0 if all pass. `--json` reports per-check status. The exit code is the contract (a runner keys on it). Build the graph first so `--check` is meaningful.
- `true-up hooks [--install|--uninstall|--ci] [--force]` — Git-backed per-repo adoption: writes/removes executable `pre-commit` + `pre-push` (resolved via `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`, honoring `core.hooksPath`/worktrees) carrying the `managed-by: true-up-hooks` marker; idempotent; backs up a pre-existing foreign hook to `*.bak` **once** (never clobbers an existing `.bak`), and `--uninstall` **restores** that backup. SAFETY: if the resolved hooks dir is **outside this repo's `.git`** (a shared/global `core.hooksPath`), `--install`/`--uninstall` **REFUSE** (exit 2) with a loud message unless `--force` — this prevents silently rewiring every repo on the machine (the incident that overwrote a dev's global hooks during `npm test`; the test harness is now git-config-isolated too). Hooks **fail closed** if `true-up` is absent. `--ci` prints a version-pinned GH Actions snippet. Exit 2 if there is no Git hooks dir. (pre-push too: `jj commit` bypasses pre-commit; non-colocated jj has no Git hooks dir for this command.)
- `true-up export --audience <public|internal|private|secret>` — emits a one-way inter-repo import snapshot from explicit `.true-up.json` `exports`. The source repo controls the allowlist; crossing from higher-visibility source material to a lower audience requires per-export `"declassify": true`. Consumers must track/stage a regular in-repo snapshot, pin `repoId` and `audience` under `imports`, then seed local advisory edges to `@alias:fact`. No live sibling-repo paths, symlink snapshots, raw values, source paths, commit ids, or executable imported generator metadata are allowed. Non-public import taint propagates through local files/facts and blocks public re-export.
- `true-up init` — scaffold a starter `.true-up.json`; **idempotent** (exit 0): never overwrites an existing config, and "already scaffolded" is success — exit 1 is reserved for gate violations everywhere else.
- `true-up capabilities` — machine-readable contract (commands, flags, exit-code dictionary, **`quickstart` task→command map, `entrypoints`, `cmd_flags`** = the live per-command flag map, `error_codes`); always JSON; exit 0. Axiom 9: an agent reads the contract from the tool, not out-of-band.
- `true-up robot-docs` (alias `--robot-help`) — paste-ready **in-tool agent handbook** (task→command recipes); writes nothing; works outside any repo; exit 0. `capabilities` is the machine CONTRACT, this is the QUICKSTART.
- `true-up --version | -v | version` — print the version; exit 0.
- `true-up --help | -h | help` — prints the command table (with a COMMON TASKS block) and **writes nothing** (exit 0). An **unknown command/flag exits 2 and writes nothing** (with a `did you mean: …` suggestion that consults the synonym map, then cross-prefix Levenshtein, then global flags) — never a silent fall-through to build+write. A **stray positional on a no-positional command exits 2** (Axiom 14 — `gate zzz` must not silently PASS).
- **`--json` on every read-side command** — a single JSON object on **stdout** (data only; diagnostics on stderr, Axiom 4) so workflows parse the result instead of regex-scraping. Every envelope carries a uniform **`ok`** (boolean pass/fail) and **`_v`** (contract version); error paths emit `{ok:false, kind, …}` on stdout too. The exit code is unchanged by `--json`.

"The workflow today" = `true-up run`. The agentic prose-rewrite `/workflow` is roadmap, not built (see Roadmap).

## Load-bearing invariants (do not regress — each is a test in `tests/engine.sh`)

1. **Directed, causal edges only.** `from` = dependent → `to` = source-of-truth. Direction basis
   ∈ {generator (a `<!-- generated by X from Y -->` marker), declared (a steward edge in config
   `seed`), anchored (`<!-- fact: path#arrayProp.key -->`), symlink (`alias-of`)}. Correlation
   (co-change/embeddings) may *propose* candidates but must NEVER assign the arrow — none are emitted.
2. **Impact is deterministic.** The worklist is content-hash + graph traversal. The LLM only
   *proposes* edits; it never decides staleness. (The prior LLM-coverage approach was
   non-deterministic and non-monotonic — that failure mode is why this rule exists.)
3. **Per-fact granularity + early-cutoff, in any language.** A content-hashed fact node comes from
   one of three extractors: steward JSON (`facts`), a **span anchor** (`true-up:anchor`/`true-up:end`
   bracketing a region of any file, zero-dep), or a **tree-sitter symbol** (opt-in `"symbols": true`).
   An anchored dependent is stale only when *its* fact's hash moves. CRITICAL: extractors only produce
   NODES — the edge still comes from an explicit anchor/seed/marker (invariant 1). Span/symbol code is
   never an exception to "correlation never assigns the arrow."
4. **Fail-loud.** An anchor that doesn't resolve to a known fact node is a hard error (stable IDs).
5. **Mechanical vs advisory.** `generated-from` / `symlink` edges are *mechanical* (regenerate, no
   LLM). `derives-facts-from` (declared or anchored) is *advisory* (a human/LLM rewrites prose).
6. **Repo-agnostic.** The engine operates on a TARGET repo (`--repo` / CWD Git/jj toplevel) driven by
   `<repo>/.true-up.json`. Nothing repo-specific is hardcoded; `run`'s regeneration is data-driven
   from each edge's `via` (the generator the marker names), never a hardcoded list.
7. **The VCS is the database — commit-optional.** The graph is a JSON file derived purely from sources
   (markers / anchors / `.true-up.json` seed), so the *real* source of truth is the repo's tracked
   content, never a DB. Committing the graph blob is **optional**: `.gitignore` ships ignoring
   `.true-up/`, and `--check` (working-tree freshness) works whether or not you commit it. For repos
   that DO commit/track the graph, `--check --committed` is the drift gate that catches "source changed
   without the regenerated graph" (a missing/untracked graph fails it). Git mode prefers the staged blob,
   then `HEAD`; jj-only mode reads `@`. Do not claim the graph "is a committed JSON file" unconditionally
   — that was an overclaim; it contradicted the shipped `.gitignore`. (A derived SQLite cache is a future
   option *only* for query-at-scale — never the source of truth.)
8. **Read-only wrt content (the write invariant).** true-up NEVER modifies/creates/deletes a content
   file. Its entire write surface is three paths: `.true-up/depgraph.json` (bare build), `.true-up.json`
   (`init`, no-clobber), and `.git/hooks/*` (opt-in Git-backed `hooks --install`). `run` mutates content ONLY by
   executing user-declared external generators (`execFileSync` of the edge's `via`) — true-up's own code
   authors no prose/code (it emits an advisory worklist; "this CLI never edits prose"). `--no-write` (a
   global, like `--json`) persists NOTHING — build computes in memory, `--impact`/`run` fall back to an
   in-memory build, `run --no-write` is a dry-run. ENFORCED by the T35 keystone (snapshot every file
   before/after every read-side command → zero content-byte change) + T38 (`--no-write` writes nothing).
   Graph writes use a temp file plus rename so concurrent agents rebuilding the same worktree graph do
   not leave a torn JSON file; tests exercise parallel builds.
   A tracked generated graph under `.true-up/` is still part of the write surface and MUST remain
   writable; only tracked *content* outputs are refused (T14b prevents the 0.1.1 regression).
   Edges are declarable **marker-free** via fact-granular `seed` (`to: path#fact` → JSON-key / span /
   symbol), with fail-loud parity (a bad seed target is a hard error, not a dropped edge). Do NOT add a
   parallel `.true-up.facts.json` hash sidecar — `--check --committed` already IS the stored-expected-hash
   verify-don't-regenerate gate (the committed graph blob holds every fact's expected hash); a second
   sidecar is a deletion-blind, merge-conflict-prone second source of truth (decision: rejected).
9. **Inter-repo dependencies are consented snapshots, never live reads.** A repo may depend on another
   repo's exported facts without the source knowing, but only through a tracked/staged local snapshot
   whose `repoId` and `audience` are pinned by the consumer. This is intentionally directional: one-way
   mirrors are allowed; federated live graph reads are not. Public/private boundaries are enforced by
   the visibility lattice (`public < internal < private < secret`), explicit declassification on the
   source side, consumer-side pins, strict snapshot schema, taint propagation, and policy/export gates.
   Local edge privacy checks compare visibility ranks, not literal directory names; a public or internal
   node deriving from `secret/` must fail even when the path is not `private/`. Every privacy failure
   found by adversarial review belongs in `tests/engine.sh`.

## Harness

Tests ARE the harness: every invariant and every past incident is a case in `tests/engine.sh`.
`npm test` runs it (sub-minute, fixture-based). When you fix a bug, add the test that catches it.

Make regression tests DETERMINISTIC, not best-effort — a guard that can't fail on the regression it
names is worse than none. Two patterns proven here: (a) the atomic graph write (temp file + `renameSync`)
is pinned by an **inode-change** assertion across two builds (rename swaps a fresh inode; an in-place
`writeFileSync` revert would keep it, so the test fails loud) — the parallel-reader race only tears at
multi-MB graphs and silently passed the revert. (b) The release **tag-coherence** guard is factored into
`scripts/ci.sh`'s `check_tag_coherence` + a hermetic `ci.sh --tag-coherence-check <ver>` hook, so the
suite exercises the EXACT guard `prepublishOnly` runs (untagged HEAD under `npm_lifecycle_event=prepublishOnly`
must hard-fail "publish blocked"; a manual run only warns) — the incident it prevents is a nested
`npm run ci` resetting `npm_lifecycle_event` and downgrading the block to a warn.
For inter-repo import/export, the harness must stay adversarial: cover path escapes, untracked or
symlinked snapshots, mismatched `repoId`/`audience`, public→non-public imports, transitive taint,
taint laundering through local fact extraction, malformed snapshot metadata, declassification, and
imported generator execution.

## Self-dogfood (true-up trues up ITSELF, marker-free)

true-up is part of developing true-up — and it does so **without a single inline marker in its own
files** (every edge is a sidecar `seed`). The wiring:

- **Source of truth → steward.** The command surface and in-tool agent guidance live in the engine
  (`HELP`, `ROBOT_DOCS`, and `capabilities`). `meta/build-contract.mjs` generates `meta/contract.json`
  (a committed steward, one fact per command plus explicit `agent_guidance` facts) from
  `true-up capabilities`. `meta/build-contract.mjs --check` is the **engine→contract drift gate**
  (fails if the steward is stale vs the engine) — run in `npm test` posttest and local CI. The generated
  steward is also modeled as a marker-free **mechanical** seed edge (`kind: generated-from`, `via:
  meta/build-contract.mjs`) from `bin/true-up`, `lib/engine.mjs`, and the generator itself.
- **Docs → contract (marker-free).** `.true-up.json` `seed` declares the dependency: `README.md`
  derives-facts-from each `meta/contract.json#commands.<name>` it documents, plus
  `meta/contract.json#agent_guidance.declared-seed-edge`; `docs/CONFIG.md` also derives from that
  agent-guidance fact. `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` derive-facts-from the whole `meta/contract.json`
  (file-granular). No `<!-- fact: -->` anchors anywhere — the build proves it (`byDirectionBasis` is
  all `declared` except symlink aliases).
- **Audience is data, not folklore.** `.true-up.json` `zones` assigns document intent and audience:
  `README.md` is for external users + agents, `SKILL.md` is for external agents, `AGENTS.md` is for
  maintainer agents, `docs/CONFIG.md` is the adopter/config reference, `PUBLISHING.md` is for
  credentialed release agents, `workflows/` is for external agents using the agentic layer,
  `scripts/ci.sh` is the local release trust anchor, `tests/engine.sh` is the regression harness,
  `meta/contract.json` is for agents + CI, and `agent_ergonomics_audit/` is the maintainer audit trail.
  The graph stamps those values onto file nodes so `true-up graph --json`
  is the query surface for "who is this artifact for?"
- **Documents depend on documents.** The seed graph also models semantic prose dependencies that no
  parser can infer: `README.md` derives its config summary from `docs/CONFIG.md`; `SKILL.md` derives
  from `README.md`, `docs/CONFIG.md`, `.true-up.json`, and the workflow overview; `AGENTS.md` derives
  from the user/agent docs plus the engine, harness, release, workflow, and local-CI surfaces it summarizes;
  `PUBLISHING.md` derives from package metadata, lockfile, changelog, installer, and local CI.
  This is intentional "more than AST" truth — if a source document changes,
  `true-up --impact <doc>` should name the dependent artifact audiences that need review.
- **Probe the case study directly.** `true-up --impact meta/contract.json#agent_guidance.declared-seed-edge`
  should name the docs that teach marker-free `seed` edges, and `true-up graph --json` should show the
  full audience/dependency map with zero `anchored`/`generator` self-edges. Tests T74/T75 pin this.
- **The tool gates itself locally.** `npm test` posttest runs `true-up gate` (`--check` + `--policy` +
  `--externalities`) on true-up's own repo, and `npm run ci` is the release trust anchor: fixture suite,
  self-gate, contract check, pack, clean-sandbox install, tarball run, negative gate, hygiene, and version
  coherence. There is intentionally no hosted GitHub Actions mirror for this repo.
- **When you add/rename/change a command:** regenerate the steward (`npm run contract`), and if it's a
  new command, add its `seed` line(s) so its doc-drift is tracked. The local `npm run ci` gate will remind
  you if you forget to regenerate.

### Durable lessons from the telltail dogfooding round

Provenance: these came from a real user dogfooding report (telltail v0.1.0) run against true-up as an
*external* repo — not our own self-trueing. Each lesson below now has a regression case in
`tests/engine.sh`; preserve them.

- **A "gate" must carry an exit code.** `--policy` and `--externalities` were documented as gates but
  unconditionally exited 0 — so CI/pre-commit could never actually block on them. A gate's contract IS
  its nonzero exit; report-only mode is opt-in (`--report`), not the default. (HIGH-1.)
- **Leak detectors must `stripCode` and offer a suppression escape hatch.** The detectors scanned raw
  content, so a doc that quoted a forbidden path/token shape inside a code span false-positived on
  itself (e.g. a privacy policy listing forbidden shapes). Fix: scan `stripCode(content)` and honor
  `<!-- true-up:ignore-line/-next [rule] -->`. A linter that can't lint its own documentation honestly
  is a foot-gun. (HIGH-2.)
- **`--check` (working-tree) ≠ `--check --committed` (drift gate).** `--check` proved rebuild-equality
  against the on-disk file; it did NOT verify the *committed* graph, despite docs promising committed
  verification — and an untracked graph silently "passed." Keep the two modes distinct and name which
  one a given gate uses; the committed-graph check must fail on an untracked blob. This also forced the
  commit-optional reconciliation above (the shipped `.gitignore` ignores `.true-up/`, contradicting any
  "the graph is a committed file" claim). (HIGH-3.)
- **`--help` (and any unknown arg) must never write.** `--help`/unknown args fell through to a silent
  build+write into the *target* repo (exit 0) — a destructive foot-gun for anyone exploring the CLI.
  `--help` now prints and writes nothing (exit 0); an unknown command exits 2 and writes nothing. A
  read-intent or malformed invocation must never mutate the target repo. (HIGH-4.)
- **A pipefail-coupled test breaks the moment a gate starts exiting nonzero — assert on output, not the
  pipeline exit.** `tests/engine.sh` runs `set -uo pipefail`; once `--policy`/`--externalities` began
  exiting 1 on violations, any `$TU … | grep …` case had its exit masked/flipped by the failing gate in
  the pipe. The durable fix is to capture and assert on the gate's OUTPUT (and separately on its `rc`),
  never on a pipeline's exit through the gate (see the comment at `tests/engine.sh` and the HIGH-1
  cases). When you make a command start exiting nonzero, audit every test that pipes from it.
- **Read the child's exit code, not its stdout.** `run`'s verify step sniffed `--policy` stdout with a
  regex to decide clean/dirty; now it reads the child process's EXIT CODE. Structured status belongs in
  the exit code, not in a stdout string a refactor can silently reword. (MED.)
- **A bad ref is an error, not an empty result.** `--impact --since <bad ref>` swallowed the failure and
  reported "0 dependents" (exit 0), which reads as "nothing is affected" — the most dangerous possible
  false negative. A ref that doesn't resolve to a commit now exits 2. (MED.)
- **No hardcoded repo-local paths in a repo-agnostic tool.** Dead hints like `node meta/build-depgraph.mjs`
  and a hardcoded `meta/depgraph.json` would `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when the tool runs against any other
  repo; use `rel(OUT)`/`rel(self)` so messages are correct in the target repo. (MED.)
- **Impact is a blast-radius list; generator execution is a separate grouping.** Telltail docs-site
  exposed the trap: 20 API pages and 17 CLI pages all depended on source generators while sharing one
  wrapper `via`. `--impact <generator-file>` must enumerate every generated page, both human and JSON;
  only `run` should deduplicate by distinct `via` when deciding what executable to invoke. If a UI ever
  groups or summarizes this, it must say how many dependents were omitted. (MED.)
- **Completed-pass audit is different from remaining-stale impact.** Prose-lint feedback surfaced a
  real audit gap: after a rename workflow edits both a source fact and its dependent docs,
  `--impact --since <ref>` can show changed facts but zero dependents because the downstream files are
  themselves changed seeds. Keep that default; it answers "what remains stale." Use `--proof` for the
  proof/report view: changed fact/source → dependents, with each dependent marked `changed-in-range` or
  `not-changed-in-range`. Do not call `changed-in-range` semantic verification; it proves edit coverage.
  (MED.)
- **Fact-model scope was a JSON-only boundary — now lifted for code (Tier 1 + Tier 2).** Historically
  `extractFacts` only decomposed top-level JSON arrays-of-objects and `listFiles` kept `.md/.json/.mjs/.js`,
  so a `.py` source-of-truth got 0 fact-nodes and was inert. Code is now fact-granular two ways, both
  reusing the same fact-node/anchor/edge/since machinery: **Tier 1 span anchors** (`extractSpans`, scans
  files containing `true-up:anchor` via `git grep -I`, zero-dep, any language) and **Tier 2 tree-sitter
  symbols** (`lib/symbols.mjs`, opt-in `CONFIG.symbols`, optional dep, `extractSymbols`). A declared
  (seed) edge to a tracked code file still works at file granularity. Design rules that MUST hold:
  (a) extractors create NODES only — edges stay explicit (anchor/seed/marker); (b) Tier 2 is
  CONFIG-driven not a transient flag, so `--check` stays deterministic, and **fails loud (exit 2)** if
  enabled-but-deps-absent rather than silently building a symbol-less graph; (c) malformed span anchors
  are IGNORED (not fatal) so a file can document the token without self-tripping — the backstop is the
  unresolved fact-anchor hard error when a doc actually depends on a missing span. (Dogfood-found: the
  build `inert` flag must key off `edges.length`, not `config.facts` — span/symbol facts make a repo
  with empty `facts` non-inert.)

## Extending

- New edge kind → give it a propagation (`mechanical`/`advisory`) and a direction basis; add a test.
- New policy rule → add to the zone `rules` vocabulary + a mechanical check; default-enforce on all
  public files where it's a leak class (see the no-machine-local-paths / private-leak pattern).
- Linter integration → keep it compositional unless a concrete user workflow proves otherwise. true-up
  should not choose or run a project's formatter/linter from `.true-up.json`; docs should show users how
  to chain their existing lint/test command with `true-up gate`, and agents should rerun
  `true-up status --since <ref>` after any formatter/lint fixer rewrites files.
- New leak detector → scan `stripCode(content)`, never the raw content: a doc that legitimately quotes
  a forbidden path/token shape inside an inline/fenced code span must not false-positive (`stripCode`
  blanks code spans while preserving line numbers). Then honor the per-line suppression directives so a
  legitimate prose example (e.g. a privacy policy showing a forbidden path shape outside a code span)
  can opt out: `<!-- true-up:ignore-line [rule] -->` and `<!-- true-up:ignore-next [rule] -->`. The
  optional `[rule]` scopes the suppression; omitted = all rules. Directives are matched against the
  ORIGINAL line text (so they survive even when `stripCode` would blank the span around them).
- New symbol language (Tier 2) → add an ext entry to `LANGS` in `lib/symbols.mjs` (grammar wasm name
  + the definition node types), confirm `tree-sitter-wasms` ships that grammar, and add a fixture
  test. Languages with a `name` field resolve cleanly; declarator-named ones (C/C++) use `nameOf`'s
  fallback. Pin grammar+runtime versions exactly (determinism) — a grammar bump re-hashes every symbol.
- Keep output deterministic (sorted, no timestamps) so `--check` stays honest.

## Running it cross-repo

Not on `PATH` after a bare clone — either `npm link` it, or (the canonical, no-install pattern) invoke
the entry directly against a target:

```
node bin/true-up --repo <target-repo> --policy
```

`--repo` | `$TRUE_UP_REPO` | git-toplevel-of-CWD | CWD selects the target (in that order). There is no
agentic prose-rewrite `/workflow` yet (roadmap) — **"run the workflow" today means `true-up run`**, the
deterministic mechanical loop. Don't point users at a `/workflow` that doesn't exist.

### Vendoring true-up (as a submodule)

A consumer may vendor true-up as a git submodule and call `node vendor/true-up/bin/true-up`. If they
clone without `--recursive`, `lib/engine.mjs` is absent; `bin/true-up` catches the `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
and prints `git submodule update --init --recursive` (exit 2) instead of a raw stack trace. For a
deterministic gate, pin the submodule to a tag and (if using Tier 2) commit the vendored `bun.lock`.

## Roadmap

- Claude Code `/workflow` for the advisory rewrites (fan-out per stale doc → minimal rewrite →
  adversarial-verify → loop until `run` is green). **Not built yet** — today the advisory worklist that
  `run` prints is reviewed/rewritten by a human or LLM; the CLI itself never edits prose.
- An installer that wires git hooks (a shared read-only gate on pre-commit AND pre-push — note that
  `jj commit` bypasses git hooks, so the gate must live on pre-push too) + CI into a target repo.
- Optional hashlines for proof/audit modes: compute line/window fingerprints with the existing crypto
  stack only when requested (for relocation/proof across parallel worktrees), never as primary graph
  identity and never persisted by default in the graph. Stable IDs remain path/fact/symbol/span/seed.
- mycelium note enrichment (knowledge layer alongside the structural graph).
